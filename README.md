# Workshop Kit.

A couple of useful documents for workshops (in the field of design, coding, hacking, new media...)

When completed, it shall include the following materials:

## Attendance Sheet

Allows to keep a quick overview of attendance of each participant. Helps in keeping discipline, useful if a review of participants is required (academic settings).

## Participant assessment forms

If it is required to provide feedback on the participant's engagement (e.g. students).

## Certificate

A certificate for participants who completed the workshop.

## Feedback form

Allows you to gather (anonymous) feedback regarding the workshop. Could be paper-based, but could also be an online survey (Google Forms, PollDaddy).
