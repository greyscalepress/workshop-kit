Greyscale Press TM Workshop Outline

# Workshop notes.
to keep in mind:

- Send minimal information to everyone participating in the workshop beforehand, so they know the topic, and expected work times. Use a mailing-list!

# Information:
*************
Information to provide in the beginning.
* Each workshop "intervenant" must introduce himself in PechaKucha style.
* Expose the time schedule of the workshop.
* Explain work methodology (Project Canvas)
* Explain technical details: file sharing.

# Keep track of absentees:
Keep track of presence/absence of people during the workshop.
Use a table grid which can be filled easily (présent, excusé, non-excusé)

# Technical:
************
- Provide possibility of printing A4 and A3 paper easily - a printer *must* be in the workshop room.

# Work methodology:
- Have a piece of wall / pinboard (project canvas) for every work group.
- IDEA: develop something along the "business model you" canvas (Alex Osterwalder) for art/design workshops.
- Objective: everyone can quickly assess what work was done, where you are on the roadmap.
- Helps people to do research.

# Technical:
- Sharing of files. Use a technology for sharing files. Ideally every school should have it's OwnCloud server.
BitTorrent Sync? AeroFS?
Create different BitTorrent keys for different sub-projects (press texts, photos).
